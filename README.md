# 3DGame
3D Video Game made using OpenGL, in a C++ basic game engine.

# Intrusctions
Unarchive GameEngine, GameEngine.VC and Dependencies. The files shall be extracted in the root directory.
Unarchive Resources in the GameEngine folder (folder obtained after extracting it from the archive).
The arhivation of the files has been done due to GIT filesize limits. You will need Visual Studio 2022 to edit and run this game.


# 3D Game in OpenGL

## Overview
This is a 3D game built using OpenGL, featuring real-time rendering, dynamic lighting, and interactive gameplay mechanics. The project showcases fundamental OpenGL concepts such as shaders, textures, and transformations.

## Features
- **Real-time rendering** with OpenGL
- **Camera system** with first-person or third-person perspective
- **Dynamic lighting and shadows**
- **Collision detection** for realistic interactions
- **User input handling** via keyboard and mouse
- **Optimized performance** for smooth gameplay

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Compile and run in Visual Studio 2022 

## Controls
- `IJKL` - Move
- `WASD` - Look around

## Dependencies
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLM (for mathematics)

## Future Improvements
- Implement more complex physics
- Improve texture quality and effects
